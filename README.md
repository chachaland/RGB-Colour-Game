# Colour Game

A simple Javascript colour guess game where you are given a randomly chosen RGB value and a number of squares depending on the mode you have selected. The goal of the game is to correctly select the sqaure with the matching RGB value.

This is not my original creation and was made as a part of Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/) course on Udemy.
